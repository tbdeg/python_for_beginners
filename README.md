# Python for Beginners

This course is a free beginners course for learning Python. Though the focus is largely for data tasks, the course is a great introduction to thinking and building software solutions with Python.

* Course will be taught using notebooks, so make sure to setup your virtual environment and install the necessary requirements (viewing of the notebooks can be done via Github).
* More content for data engineering and web are forthcoming as we expand the course.
