# Python for Beginners Course Syllabus

### Overview

This course is intended to be a modular introduction series for people interested in using Python. This course is composed of 5 initial sections which will take the learner from zero knowledge to a basic, well-rounded scope of Python programming with a focus on data tasks. More sections are planned and will be added to the syllabus and GitHub repository as soon as they are reviewed.

The 5 initial sections are:

* **Introduction to Python Programming Language - Part 1**
    * This is intended for newcomers to Python who have little or no knowledge of how to get started. The course and the learning objectives will be reviewed, special considerations for learners will be discussed, and time will be given for questions.
* **Introduction to Python Programming Language - Part 2**
    * For those who are new or need a refresher, this section is meant to expose learners to the Python programming language. Understanding of the programming language will be important for applying its functionality to later sections.
* **Data Collection**
    * In this section, we will focus on how to gather and process data for analysis. This will cover a wide range of data formats and ETL techniques.
* **Data Analysis**
    * After processing and formatting the data, this section will cover specialized libraries and techniques for doing data analysis with Python. This will cover basic statistical learning concepts and processes for doing basic manipulation and analysis.
* **Data Visualization**
    * The final section will cover topics on visualizing your data. This will cover useful libraries that can display data in visualizations ranging from simple charts to complex maps.

The readings for each section are suggested and learners are encouraged to find and use alternative materials to accomplish the learning goals for each section. Understanding that some of the texts can be expensive, free online tutorials and blog posts are more than fine for the purpose of learning and adapting Python to data analysis tasks.

Everyone will work through the materials and help each other in understanding the exercises and challenges over the course of each month. This is an informal learning experience in which students are encouraged to contribute and change course materials as the course progresses.

### Learning Objectives

* Gain a working understanding of the Python programming language
* Gain a working knowledge of how to collect and process data in Python
* Gain a good understanding of how to perform data manipulation and analysis in Python
* Gain a good understanding of how to visualize your analytic results using Python

### Meetings/Discussions

The immersion course learning group will meet based upon a schedule established during the first meeting. Each meeting, we will:

1. Discuss the previous month’s readings
2. Share experiences with the materials
3. Discuss specific areas of interest for which the learners found challenges in using Python or applying concepts to specific data science tasks.

The Tampa Devs Slack #python channel will be the online common place for learners to discuss the immersion course content.
Our in-person meeting location will be decided no less than one week prior to each event (usually this will be know at least a month in advance). All in-person events will be scheduled and posted via Meetup and Slack.
